# OpenAPI Webhooks

There are cases where you want to tell your API **users** that your app could call *their* app (sending a request) with some data, normally to **notify** of some type of **event**.

This means that instead of the normal process of your users sending requests to your API, it's **your API** (or your app) that could **send requests to their system** (to their API, their app).

This is normally called a **webhook**.

## Webhooks steps

The process normally is that **you define** in your code what is the message that you will send, the **body of the request**.

You also define in some way at which **moments** your app will send those requests or events.

And **your users** define in some way (for example in a web dashboard somewhere) the **URL** where your app should send those requests.

All the **logic** about how to register the URLs for webhooks and the code to actually send those requests is up to you. You write it however you want to in **your own code**.

## Documenting webhooks with **FastAPI** and OpenAPI

With **FastAPI**, using OpenAPI, you can define the names of these webhooks, the types of HTTP operations that your app can send (e.g. `POST`, `PUT`, etc.) and the request **bodies** that your app would send.

This can make it a lot easier for your users to **implement their APIs** to receive your **webhook** requests, they might even be able to autogenerate some of their own API code.

!!! info
    Webhooks are available in OpenAPI 3.1.0 and above, supported by FastAPI `0.99.0` and above.

## An app with webhooks

When you create a **FastAPI** application, there is a `webhooks` attribute that you can use to define *webhooks*, the same way you would define *path operations*, for example with `@app.webhooks.post()`.

```Python hl_lines="9-13  36-53"
{!../../../docs_src/openapi_webhooks/tutorial001.py!}
```

The webhooks that you define will end up in the **OpenAPI** schema and the automatic **docs UI**.

!!! info
    The `app.webhooks` object is actually just an `APIRouter`, the same type you would use when structuring your app with multiple files.

Notice that with webhooks you are actually not declaring a *path* (like `/items/`), the text you pass there is just an **identifier** of the webhook (the name of the event), for example in `@app.webhooks.post("new-subscription")`, the webhook name is `new-subscription`.

This is because it is expected that **your users** would define the actual **URL path** where they want to receive the webhook request in some other way (e.g. a web dashboard).

### Check the docs

Now you can start your app and go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" class="external-link" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs</a>.

You will see your docs have the normal *path operations* and now also some **webhooks**:
