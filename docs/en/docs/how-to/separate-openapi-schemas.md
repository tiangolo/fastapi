# Separate OpenAPI Schemas for Input and Output or Not

When using **Pydantic v2**, the generated OpenAPI is a bit more exact and **correct** than before. 😎

In fact, in some cases, it will even have **two JSON Schemas** in OpenAPI for the same Pydantic model, for input and output, depending on if they have **default values**.

Let's see how that works and how to change it if you need to do that.

!!! info
    In the current behavior of pydantic separate output schemas are only created if the config
    option `json_schema_serialization_defaults_required` is set to `True`.

## Pydantic Models for Input and Output

Let's say you have a Pydantic model with default values, like this one:

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python hl_lines="9"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py[ln:1-9]!}

    # Code below omitted 👇
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>👀 Full file preview</summary>

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py!}
    ```

    </details>

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="11"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py39.py[ln:1-11]!}

    # Code below omitted 👇
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>👀 Full file preview</summary>

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py39.py!}
    ```

    </details>

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="11"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001.py[ln:1-11]!}

    # Code below omitted 👇
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>👀 Full file preview</summary>

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

    </details>

### Model for Input

If you use this model as an input like here:

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python hl_lines="16"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py[ln:1-17]!}

    # Code below omitted 👇
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>👀 Full file preview</summary>

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py!}
    ```

    </details>

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="18"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py39.py[ln:1-19]!}

    # Code below omitted 👇
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>👀 Full file preview</summary>

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py39.py!}
    ```

    </details>

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="18"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001.py[ln:1-19]!}

    # Code below omitted 👇
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>👀 Full file preview</summary>

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

    </details>

...then the `description` field will **not be required**. Because it has a default value of `None`.

### Input Model in Docs

You can confirm that in the docs, the `description` field doesn't have a **red asterisk**, it's not marked as required:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image01.png">
</div>

### Model for Output

But if you use the same model as an output, like here:

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python hl_lines="20"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py310.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="22"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="22"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

...then because `description` has a default value, if you **don't return anything** for that field, it will still have that **default value**.

### Model for Output Response Data

If you interact with the docs and check the response, even though the code didn't add anything in one of the `description` fields, the JSON response contains the default value (`null`):

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image02.png">
</div>

This means that it will **always have a value**, it's just that sometimes the value could be `None` (or `null` in JSON).

That means that, clients using your API don't have to check if the value exists or not, they can **assume the field will always be there**, but just that in some cases it will have the default value of `None`.

The way to describe this in OpenAPI, is to mark that field as **required**, because it will always be there.

Because of that, the JSON Schema for a model can be different depending on if it's used for **input or output**:

- for **input** the `description` will **not be required**
- for **output** it will be **required** (and possibly `None`, or in JSON terms, `null`)

### Model for Output in Docs

You can check the output model in the docs too, **both** `name` and `description` are marked as **required** with a **red asterisk**:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image03.png">
</div>

### Model for Input and Output in Docs

And if you check all the available Schemas (JSON Schemas) in OpenAPI, you will see that there are two, one `Item-Input` and one `Item-Output`.

For `Item-Input`, `description` is **not required**, it doesn't have a red asterisk.

But for `Item-Output`, `description` is **required**, it has a red asterisk.

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image04.png">
</div>

With this feature from **Pydantic v2**, your API documentation is more **precise**, and if you have autogenerated clients and SDKs, they will be more precise too, with a better **developer experience** and consistency. 🎉

## Do not Separate Schemas

Now, there are some cases where you might want to have the **same schema for input and output**.

Probably the main use case for this is if you already have some autogenerated client code/SDKs and you don't want to update all the autogenerated client code/SDKs yet, you probably will want to do it at some point, but maybe not right now.

In that case, you can disable this feature in **FastAPI**, with the parameter `separate_input_output_schemas=False`.

!!! info
    Support for `separate_input_output_schemas` was added in FastAPI `0.102.0`. 🤓

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python hl_lines="12"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial002_py310.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="14"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial002_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="14"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/separate_openapi_schemas/tutorial002.py!}
    ```

### Same Schema for Input and Output Models in Docs

And now there will be one single schema for input and output for the model, only `Item`, and it will have `description` as **not required**:

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="/img/tutorial/separate-openapi-schemas/image05.png">
</div>

This is the same behavior as in Pydantic v1. 🤓
