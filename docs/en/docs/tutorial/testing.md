# Testing

Thanks to <a href="https://www.starlette.io/testclient/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Starlette</a>, testing **FastAPI** applications is easy and enjoyable.

It is based on <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTPX</a>, which in turn is designed based on Requests, so it's very familiar and intuitive.

With it, you can use <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">pytest</a> directly with **FastAPI**.

## Using `TestClient`

!!! info
    To use `TestClient`, first install <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">`httpx`</a>.

    E.g. `pip install httpx`.

Import `TestClient`.

Create a `TestClient` by passing your **FastAPI** application to it.

Create functions with a name that starts with `test_` (this is standard `pytest` conventions).

Use the `TestClient` object the same way as you do with `httpx`.

Write simple `assert` statements with the standard Python expressions that you need to check (again, standard `pytest`).

```Python hl_lines="2  12  15-18"
{!../../../docs_src/app_testing/tutorial001.py!}
```

!!! tip
    Notice that the testing functions are normal `def`, not `async def`.

    And the calls to the client are also normal calls, not using `await`.

    This allows you to use `pytest` directly without complications.

!!! note "Technical Details"
    You could also use `from starlette.testclient import TestClient`.

    **FastAPI** provides the same `starlette.testclient` as `fastapi.testclient` just as a convenience for you, the developer. But it comes directly from Starlette.

!!! tip
    If you want to call `async` functions in your tests apart from sending requests to your FastAPI application (e.g. asynchronous database functions), have a look at the [Async Tests](../advanced/async-tests.md){.internal-link target=_blank} in the advanced tutorial.

## Separating tests

In a real application, you probably would have your tests in a different file.

And your **FastAPI** application might also be composed of several files/modules, etc.

### **FastAPI** app file

Let's say you have a file structure as described in [Bigger Applications](bigger-applications.md){.internal-link target=_blank}:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main.py
```

In the file `main.py` you have your **FastAPI** app:


```Python
{!../../../docs_src/app_testing/main.py!}
```

### Testing file

Then you could have a file `test_main.py` with your tests. It could live on the same Python package (the same directory with a `__init__.py` file):

``` hl_lines="5"
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

Because this file is in the same package, you can use relative imports to import the object `app` from the `main` module (`main.py`):

```Python hl_lines="3"
{!../../../docs_src/app_testing/test_main.py!}
```

...and have the code for the tests just like before.

## Testing: extended example

Now let's extend this example and add more details to see how to test different parts.

### Extended **FastAPI** app file

Let's continue with the same file structure as before:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── test_main.py
```

Let's say that now the file `main.py` with your **FastAPI** app has some other **path operations**.

It has a `GET` operation that could return an error.

It has a `POST` operation that could return several errors.

Both *path operations* require an `X-Token` header.

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b_an_py310/main.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b_an_py39/main.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b_an/main.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.10+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b_py310/main.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python
    {!> ../../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b/main.py!}
    ```

### Extended testing file

You could then update `test_main.py` with the extended tests:

```Python
{!> ../../../docs_src/app_testing/app_b/test_main.py!}
```

Whenever you need the client to pass information in the request and you don't know how to, you can search (Google) how to do it in `httpx`, or even how to do it with `requests`, as HTTPX's design is based on Requests' design.

Then you just do the same in your tests.

E.g.:

* To pass a *path* or *query* parameter, add it to the URL itself.
* To pass a JSON body, pass a Python object (e.g. a `dict`) to the parameter `json`.
* If you need to send *Form Data* instead of JSON, use the `data` parameter instead.
* To pass *headers*, use a `dict` in the `headers` parameter.
* For *cookies*, a `dict` in the `cookies` parameter.

For more information about how to pass data to the backend (using `httpx` or the `TestClient`) check the <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org" class="external-link" target="_blank">HTTPX documentation</a>.

!!! info
    Note that the `TestClient` receives data that can be converted to JSON, not Pydantic models.

    If you have a Pydantic model in your test and you want to send its data to the application during testing, you can use the `jsonable_encoder` described in [JSON Compatible Encoder](encoder.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

## Run it

After that, you just need to install `pytest`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install pytest

---> 100%
```

</div>

It will detect the files and tests automatically, execute them, and report the results back to you.

Run the tests with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pytest
