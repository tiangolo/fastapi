# Path Parameters and Numeric Validations

In the same way that you can declare more validations and metadata for query parameters with `Query`, you can declare the same type of validations and metadata for path parameters with `Path`.

## Import Path

First, import `Path` from `fastapi`, and import `Annotated`:

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python hl_lines="1  3"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an_py310.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="1  3"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="3-4"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.10+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="1"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_py310.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="3"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

!!! info
    FastAPI added support for `Annotated` (and started recommending it) in version 0.95.0.

    If you have an older version, you would get errors when trying to use `Annotated`.

    Make sure you [Upgrade the FastAPI version](../deployment/versions.md#upgrading-the-fastapi-versions){.internal-link target=_blank} to at least 0.95.1 before using `Annotated`.

## Declare metadata

You can declare all the same parameters as for `Query`.

For example, to declare a `title` metadata value for the path parameter `item_id` you can type:

=== "Python 3.10+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an_py310.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="11"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.10+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="8"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001_py310.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

!!! note
    A path parameter is always required as it has to be part of the path. Even if you declared it with `None` or set a default value, it would not affect anything, it would still be always required.

## Order the parameters as you need

!!! tip
    This is probably not as important or necessary if you use `Annotated`.

Let's say that you want to declare the query parameter `q` as a required `str`.

And you don't need to declare anything else for that parameter, so you don't really need to use `Query`.

But you still need to use `Path` for the `item_id` path parameter. And you don't want to use `Annotated` for some reason.

Python will complain if you put a value with a "default" before a value that doesn't have a "default".

But you can re-order them, and have the value without a default (the query parameter `q`) first.

It doesn't matter for **FastAPI**. It will detect the parameters by their names, types and default declarations (`Query`, `Path`, etc), it doesn't care about the order.

So, you can declare your function as:

=== "Python 3.8 non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="7"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial002.py!}
    ```

But keep in mind that if you use `Annotated`, you won't have this problem, it won't matter as you're not using the function parameter default values for `Query()` or `Path()`.

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial002_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="9"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial002_an.py!}
    ```

## Order the parameters as you need, tricks

!!! tip
    This is probably not as important or necessary if you use `Annotated`.

Here's a **small trick** that can be handy, but you won't need it often.

If you want to:

* declare the `q` query parameter without a `Query` nor any default value
* declare the path parameter `item_id` using `Path`
* have them in a different order
* not use `Annotated`

...Python has a little special syntax for that.

Pass `*`, as the first parameter of the function.

Python won't do anything with that `*`, but it will know that all the following parameters should be called as keyword arguments (key-value pairs), also known as <abbr title="From: K-ey W-ord Arg-uments"><code>kwargs</code></abbr>. Even if they don't have a default value.

```Python hl_lines="7"
{!../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial003.py!}
```

### Better with `Annotated`

Keep in mind that if you use `Annotated`, as you are not using function parameter default values, you won't have this problem, and you probably won't need to use `*`.

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial003_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="9"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial003_an.py!}
    ```

## Number validations: greater than or equal

With `Query` and `Path` (and others you'll see later) you can declare number constraints.

Here, with `ge=1`, `item_id` will need to be an integer number "`g`reater than or `e`qual" to `1`.

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial004_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="9"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial004_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="8"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial004.py!}
    ```

## Number validations: greater than and less than or equal

The same applies for:

* `gt`: `g`reater `t`han
* `le`: `l`ess than or `e`qual

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial005_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="9"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial005_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="9"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial005.py!}
    ```

## Number validations: floats, greater than and less than

Number validations also work for `float` values.

Here's where it becomes important to be able to declare <abbr title="greater than"><code>gt</code></abbr> and not just <abbr title="greater than or equal"><code>ge</code></abbr>. As with it you can require, for example, that a value must be greater than `0`, even if it is less than `1`.

So, `0.5` would be a valid value. But `0.0` or `0` would not.

And the same for <abbr title="less than"><code>lt</code></abbr>.

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="13"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial006_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="12"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial006_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="11"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/path_params_numeric_validations/tutorial006.py!}
    ```

## Recap

With `Query`, `Path` (and others you haven't seen yet) you can declare metadata and string validations in the same ways as with [Query Parameters and String Validations](query-params-str-validations.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

And you can also declare numeric validations:

* `gt`: `g`reater `t`han
* `ge`: `g`reater than or `e`qual
* `lt`: `l`ess `t`han
* `le`: `l`ess than or `e`qual

!!! info
    `Query`, `Path`, and other classes you will see later are subclasses of a common `Param` class.

    All of them share the same parameters for additional validation and metadata you have seen.

!!! note "Technical Details"
    When you import `Query`, `Path` and others from `fastapi`, they are actually functions.

    That when called, return instances of classes of the same name.

    So, you import `Query`, which is a function. And when you call it, it returns an instance of a class also named `Query`.

    These functions are there (instead of just using the classes directly) so that your editor doesn't mark errors about their types.

    That way you can use your normal editor and coding tools without having to add custom configurations to disregard those errors.
