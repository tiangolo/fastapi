# Request Forms and Files

You can define files and form fields at the same time using `File` and `Form`.

!!! info
    To receive uploaded files and/or form data, first install <a href="https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart" class="external-link" target="_blank">`python-multipart`</a>.

    E.g. `pip install python-multipart`.

## Import `File` and `Form`

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="3"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/request_forms_and_files/tutorial001_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="1"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/request_forms_and_files/tutorial001_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="1"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/request_forms_and_files/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

## Define `File` and `Form` parameters

Create file and form parameters the same way you would for `Body` or `Query`:

=== "Python 3.9+"

    ```Python hl_lines="10-12"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/request_forms_and_files/tutorial001_an_py39.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+"

    ```Python hl_lines="9-11"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/request_forms_and_files/tutorial001_an.py!}
    ```

=== "Python 3.8+ non-Annotated"

    !!! tip
        Prefer to use the `Annotated` version if possible.

    ```Python hl_lines="8"
    {!> ../../../docs_src/request_forms_and_files/tutorial001.py!}
    ```

The files and form fields will be uploaded as form data and you will receive the files and form fields.

And you can declare some of the files as `bytes` and some as `UploadFile`.

!!! warning
    You can declare multiple `File` and `Form` parameters in a *path operation*, but you can't also declare `Body` fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using `multipart/form-data` instead of `application/json`.

    This is not a limitation of **FastAPI**, it's part of the HTTP protocol.

## Recap

Use `File` and `Form` together when you need to receive data and files in the same request.
