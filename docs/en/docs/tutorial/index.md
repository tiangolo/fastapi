# Tutorial - User Guide

This tutorial shows you how to use **FastAPI** with most of its features, step by step.

Each section gradually builds on the previous ones. Each section is a separate topic, so that you can go directly to any specific topic to solve your specific API need.

The tutorial is also built to work as a future reference, so you can come back and see exactly what you need.

## Run the code

All code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are tested Python files).

To run any of the examples, copy the code to a file `main.py`, and start `uvicorn` with:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Started reloader process [28720]
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Started server process [28722]
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Waiting for application startup.
<span style="color: green;">INFO</span>:     Application startup complete.
```

</div>

It is **HIGHLY encouraged** that you write or copy the code, edit it and run it locally.

Using it in your editor is what really shows you the benefits of FastAPI, seeing how little code you have to write, all the type checks, autocompletion, etc.

## Install FastAPI

The first step is to install FastAPI.

For the tutorial, you might want to install it with all the optional dependencies and features:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install "fastapi[all]"

---> 100%
```

</div>

...that also includes `uvicorn`, which you can use as the server that runs your code.

!!! note
    You can also install it part by part.

    This is what you would probably do to deploy your application to production:

    ```
    pip install fastapi
    ```

    Also install `uvicorn` to act as the server:

    ```
    pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
    ```

    And then install each of the optional dependencies that you want to use.

## Advanced User Guide

There is also an **Advanced User Guide** that you can read later after this **Tutorial - User guide**.

The **Advanced User Guide**, builds on this one, uses the same concepts, and teaches you some extra features.

But you should read the **Tutorial - User Guide** first (the document you are reading right now).

FastAPI is designed so that you can build a complete application with just the **Tutorial - User Guide**, and then extend it as needed, using the additional ideas from the **Advanced User Guide**.
